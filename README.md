apachecker
==========

apachecker is a simple utility to check that an APA formatted manuscript has no
errors in it. The checks include:
 - checking that each reference in the manuscript is included in the list of references
 - no entries in the list of references are extraneous

It's of course preferrable to use a manuscript generation tool that will create correct
references automatically. But often the submitted manuscript comes back with change requests,
and often you find yourself working with a Word file. This tool can be useful in checking that
you make no errors in the final stages of editing.
